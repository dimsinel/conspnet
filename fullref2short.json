There is asimilar obscurity or even inscrutability about theplotters' true goals in a spate of White House coverup films that all appeared in 1997, inspired perhapsby the cumulative effect of years of pre–MonicaLewinsky Clinton rumors: Shadow Conspiracy (dir.George P. Cosmatos), Absolute Power (dir. ClintEastwood), Murder at 1600 (dir. Dwight Little), andthe best of the lot, the brilliant satire Wag the Dog(dir. Barry Levinson), in which a war is manufactured in order to divert attention from sex allegationsconcerning the president and an underage girl.Antiestablishment Conspiracies:Beyond \"Left” and \"Right”In several films the source of the conspiracy is foundnot in the establishment or some part of it, butcomes from the opposition to the establishment. Thenature of the conspiracy is nevertheless the same: itis usually vast, has sweeping but (at best) onlyvaguely defined goals, and can operate anywhere atany time, with everyone potentially a secret adherentof it. In political terms, these antiestablishment conspiracies resist ascription to traditional categorieslike right- and left-wing. The all male and almost allwhite members of the aptly named Project Mayhemconspiracy in Fight Club (dir. David Fincher 1999)seek to blow up corporate buildings, but not so muchto subvert capitalism as to restore their masculinity,which they believe they have forfeited in the emptyconsumerism of modern life. Threatening a policecommissioner with (appropriately enough) castration for trying to shut down the \"fight clubs” fromwhich he recruits volunteers, their charismaticleader boasts that \"we know everything aboutyou . . . We control every part of your life.”Going one better than The Parallax View's JosephFrady, who was blamed for the political assassination he died trying to prevent, Michael Faraday inArlington Road (dir. Mark Pellington 1999) unwittingly delivers the explosives that blow up the FBIbuilding, for which he also takes the blame posthumously, rather than the antigovernment conspirators, who appear to be ordinary middle-class suburbanites with no interest in politics of any kind.\fFilm and Conspiracy TheorySimilarly opposed to the status quo is the eponymous conspiracy in Twelve Monkeys (dir. TerryGilliam 1995), which plans to return the planet tothe animals, a goal that is accomplished by releasinga plague virus that affects only humans.Epidemics, Medical Experiments,and the UnexplainableThe epidemic motif has featured in other conspiracyfilms, notably The Andromeda Strain (dir. RobertWise 1971) and Outbreak (dir. Wolfgang Petersen1995), in both of which scientists are co-opted by themilitary into developing as weapons new diseaseorganisms, from outer space in the former film andfrom Africa in the latter. (The cold war era film TheSatan Bug [dir. John Sturges 1965] also has a secretgovernment lab experimenting with deadly microorganisms, one of which is stolen for use in an extortion plot.) Sometimes the government experimentson people directly, but without their knowledge, toalter them in desired ways. This happens during theVietnam War to the protagonists of both Jacob'sLadder (dir. Adrian Lyne 1990) and the RogerCorman-produced The Capitol Conspiracy (a.k.a.The Prophet) (dir. Fred Olen Ray 1999). In the former the purpose is to enhance soldiers' will to fightand in the latter to endow orphaned children withextrasensory powers. Paranormal children are alsocreated by the government in the miniseries SoleSurvivor (dir. Mikael Salomon 2000), while a conspiracy of mutant teenagers to take over the world isopposed by pro-human mutants in X-Men (dir.Bryan Singer 2000), and a conspiracy to use massproduced human clones to do the same features inThe 6th Day (dir. Roger Spottiswoode 2000).In four eerie films from the mid-1990s, so little isrevealed about what seems like a conspiracy that itis left uncertain whether there even is one. In Safe(dir. Todd Haynes 1995) and The Trigger Effect (dir.David Koepp 1996), something in the environmentcauses mysterious allergic reactions in the formerfilm and a general breakdown of the entire socialfabric in the latter. The prisoners in Cube (dir. Vincenzo Natali 1997) are unacquainted with eachother and have no idea who imprisoned them orwhy, while the mathematician protagonist of Pi:Faith in Chaos (dir. Darren Aronofsky 1997) findshimself pursued by stockbrokers and OrthodoxJews because he may possess a secret that no onecan begin to explain rationally. These are so-calledindependent films and their quirkiness might bedismissed as typical of \"indies,” but in the late 1990sconspiracy films more in the mainstream displayedcomparable characteristics.Conspiracies of Infinite RegressAs billionaire Nicholas Van Orton learns in TheGame (dir. David Fincher 1997), the employees ofConsumer Recreation Services (CRS) could be anyone and everyone he might encounter, and therefore what he takes to be the real world populated byreal people could be just that, but then again itmight also be an elaborate fiction engineered as abirthday present from his brother for making hislife more exhilarating; or as a scheme for stealinghis money in which his brother may or may not becomplicit; or as a benign plot to help him overcomethe childhood trauma of his father's suicide; or as amalign plot to induce him into following in hisfather's footsteps (i.e., off a roof); or as somethingthe film cagily refuses to reveal, inasmuch as theending leaves open the possibility that the \"game” isstill being played, or even that there has never beena time when it wasn't. In other words, the realworld/game world distinction is in an infiniteregress that doesn't need to be sustained by resorting to more obvious devices like \"virtual reality”(VR)—although the VR concept can be intelligentlyexploited, as in The Thirteenth Floor (dir. Josef Rusnak 1999), in which the solution to a murder in\"our” world must be sought in a VR world inhabitedby virtual \"people” whose motivations, despite theirpreprogramming, are ultimately as indeterminableas those of the CRS employees in The Game.The Truman Show, DarkCity, and The MatrixThree important conspiracy films from the lastyears of the last century add a further twist. Notonly is the conspiracy vast, beyond politics and existential in its implications, but all of us are made tofeel a part of it, actually or potentially.261\fFilm and Conspiracy TheoryTruman Burbank in The Truman Show (dir. PeterWeir 1998) lives in an artificial world, but for him,and for him alone, there is no other world, becauseeveryone except him is complicit in a conspiracy tosustain his belief that his world is the only one. Thisis because the town in which he has been raisedsince birth and subtly prevented ever escaping fromis really a giant television studio equipped withcountless hidden cameras and microphones, and allthe people he has ever known whether intimately orcasually are, unknown to him, actors in the employof a director with the sacrilegious name of Christof.At the same time, everyone in the world Trumanhas never met is a voyeur of his life as Christofarranges it to unfold in his round-the-clock TVshow, the popularity of which implies acceptance ofthe ever-increasing surveillance and control in theirown daily lives on the part of the television audience and, by extension, of the film's audience. AsChristof says of Truman, he \"prefers his cell.”In Dark City (dir. Alex Proyas 1998) another artificial world has been created in space and populated with kidnapped humans by a dying race ofaliens, the Strangers, who possess \"the ability toalter physical reality by will alone,” as explained inthe opening voice-over narration from Daniel PaulSchreber, a psychiatrist ironically named after aturn-of-the-last-century paranoid whose delusionswere studied by Sigmund Freud. Every night, whilethe Strangers are altering physical reality, Schreberrearranges the entire population's memories so thatthe aliens can experiment on them. One human,Murdoch, discovers that he has the same powers.But after defeating the Strangers he simply takestheir place, instituting a regime that, although presumably more benign, is no less total in its controlover the malleable populace.So total and all enveloping is the conspiracy in TheMatrix (dir. Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski1999) that it has a name that evokes the womb. Inthe far future renegade computers have imprisonedmost of the human race in pods in order to harvesttheir bodies' electrical energy, while keeping thempacified with the cybernetically induced illusion thatthey are in 1999 New York. As Agent Smith puts it(he is part of a special program that hunts down262members of the human resistance who have escapedtheir pods and reentered the VR environment of theMatrix to carry out sabotage), in their own mindsthey are merely \"billions of people just living outtheir lives, oblivious.” But unfortunately for them (orso it would seem), the contentment they experiencein their \"prison that you cannot smell or taste ortouch,” as the rebel leader Morpheus describes theMatrix, is so great that \"they will fight to protect it.”This means that, in order to prevail, Morpheus'speople, who of course also constitute a conspiracy,would need to destroy all those oblivious billions.Freedom versus Security?In these films, ordinary people's acceptance of andcomplicity in a conspiracy against their own autonomy, their privacy, their individuality and even theirexistence leave a depressing aftertaste despite saccharine romantic endings. Perhaps the message isone of resignation: the emerging regime of surveillance and control is inexorably eroding whatremains of our freedom, and many of us, if not all,are resigned to accept this, and, perhaps in hope ofgreater security as a trade-off, even to embrace it.Ken HarrisSee also: AIDS; African Americans;Anticommunism; Area 51; Central IntelligenceAgency; Clinton, Bill and Hillary; Cold War; Drugs;Hollywood Ten; House Un-American ActivitiesCommittee; Illuminati; Ku Klux Klan; TheManchurian Candidate; National Security Agency;New World Order; Nixon, Richard; Pakula, Alan J.;Patriarchy; Skull and Bones Society; Stone, Oliver;Subliminal Advertising; UFOs; United Nations;Watergate; The X-Files.References":["identity (1995)"],"Lifton, David. 1988.
