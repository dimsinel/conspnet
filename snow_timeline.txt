Timeline
This timeline provides a listing of some of
the most influential events, figures, and publications in the history and study of social
movements beginning in the eighteenth century, which has been referred to as the “Age
of Reason and Change.” Understandably, the
listing is not comprehensive; many important social movements and scholarly works
from around the world during this period
are missing. However, in indicating many of
the major events, movements, and influential scholarly publications across this period,

the timeline underscores the centrality and
salience of social movements and related
phenomena in the flow of history over the
past 300+ years.
In order to facilitate identification of the
three different clusters of listings, they are
keyed accordingly: events and movements
are in bold; selected figures/leaders are
underlined; and publications are in regular
font style and italics. Not all of the listings of
events and figures have associated entries in
the encyclopedia, but many do.
